# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

1.  Inspect the first few lines of the data set

2.  Is there a variable of special interest?

3.  Start the exploration with the main variable:

What is the range of the variable? Draw a histogram for a numeric
variable or a bar chart, if the variable is categorical. What is the
general pattern? Is there anything odd?

4.  Pick a variable that might be related to the main variable.

what is the range of that variable? plot. describe the pattern.

what is the relationship to the main variable? plot a scatterplot,
boxplot or facetted barcharts (dependening on the types of variables
involved). Describe overall pattern, does this variable describe any
oddities discovered in 3? Identify/follow-up on any oddities.
